We're glad to see that you are interested in web site accessibility because we are too. Our entire brand is based on encouraging truth and kindness. We feel strongly that creating an inclusive and welcoming experience is a core part of that mission.

We here at Truth Kind are very interested in providing a site where all of our current and future friends can explore our message and our products. Unfortunately, we've just begun our online journey and we are sure that we haven't got it all worked out yet. If you discover part of our site that is difficult to use, please let us know and we will do our best to make corrections.

In an effort to be transparent, we'd like to share some information on the areas that we are currently working to make better. We'll also include the date posted so that you can call us out if we let this get stale.

We are starting our accessibility related enhancements based on recommendations from the "WAVE" tool from [WebAIM](https://webaim.org/). Hopefully this is a good starting point, because there is a bit of conflicting information on the web regarding best practices. If you have any opinions on this tool, we'd love to hear them.

* Proper alternative text for all images
* eliminating empty links left over from starting template
* reducing redundant links

We understand that automated tools can only take us so far and we look forward to a time when we can afford to have dedicated staff to improve the accessibility of our site and to evaluate the merits of potential partners. For now, we are a tiny start up and will do our best.

We appreciate any and all suggestions sent to feedback@truthkind.com

Thanks!
